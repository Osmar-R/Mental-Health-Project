             <p>Don't be afraid to ask for help. If you need help, it's out there, you just have to go find it. I found my help with Not Just You and they have helped me through my ups and downs throughout the years. The 24/7 services provided is outstanding and as clich√© as it sounds, you really aren't alone. There's so many people going through similar battles but there's just as many people seeking help, and Not Just You can provide that help.</p>

             <p class="role">Member Since 2020</p>
             <p>2020 has been a ride. Alot of us struggled with the global lifestyle shifts, mentally and physically. We are our worst enemy, our hardest critiquer, our biggest bully. Some fear for the worst to happen to us, but sometimes we need a little help to get us back on a healthy track. After working with Not Just You, it really isn't just you, there's millions out there who go through mental hardships and some aren't prepared to seek help or even know where to go first to get help, but it's out here and Not Just You can help you reach any, if not all, of your dreams!</p>
