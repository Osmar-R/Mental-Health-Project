                        Talking with a therapist or counselor can help you deal with thoughts, behaviors, symptoms,
                        stresses, goals, past experiences and other areas that can promote your recovery. Of course,
                        talking with a therapist about personal issues can be tough, but it can help you come to grips
                        with problems in your life. It can also offer an emotional release and a sense of really being
                        heard,
                        understood and supported.
