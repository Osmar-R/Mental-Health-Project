        <p> Not Just You is a non-profit organization that was founded in 2010 by a group named FAMIO which included five individuals Fatima, Andrew, Itzel, Osmar, and Marisol. Our organization is passionate about bringing
            awareness to mental health and always working on new ways to help break the stigma on mental illness. Our goal
            is to help the physical and mental wellbeing of anyone who reaches out to us to ultimately lead to decreased suicide rates in the community.</p>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <img id="our-mission" src="images/group.jpg" alt="group of people">
        <p> Suicide isnâ€™t always a plan to put a gun to your head and pull the trigger. There are other signs of self-harming that includes
            under-eating or overeating on a daily basis, overdoing it with drugs and alcohol, continuing to live in an
            abusive and dangerous environment, sleeping with no roof over your head on the cold streets. Our mission with "Not Just You" is to be dedicated to building better lives for the millions of people
            affected by mental illness and promoting the overall importance of mental health. If
